# car_animation
This project features a car animation created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The car moves smoothly with spinning wheels, powered by CSS keyframes, and includes background audio for a more immersive experience. While it works well on standard screens, it is not fully responsive yet. This project helped me practice animations and audio integration.
